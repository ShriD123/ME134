# ME134: Caltech Autonomy Project
 This project contains the code to play hackysack battleship against a human opponent autonomously. This involves using two robotic arms, one camera, and a few ROS nodes to understand the game state, the robot state, the camera state, as well as error-correcting functionality and stimulus response logic.
